    "text": "Department: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with data analysis techniques to inform design decisions in an uncertain, competitive market; topics include consumer choice modeling, programming in the R programming language, survey design, conjoint analysis, optimization, market simulation, and professional communication skills. Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate design insights. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a presentation of their findings. This course has a ‚Äúflipped‚Äù classroom structure. Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class, students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice questions.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nImport, wrangle, visualize, and export data in R.\nDesign surveys to obtain informative data about consumer preferences for product features.\nBuild and estimate discrete choice models.\nAnalyze consumer choice data to estimate consumer preferences for product features.\nDesign and create effective charts and presentations.\nCommunicate results in terms of design insights.\n\nPrerequisites:\nThis course requires prior exposure to:\n\nProbability theory\nMultivariable calculus\nLinear algebra\nRegression\n\nEach of these concepts will be applied throughout the course, and no time will be spent reviewing the foundational elements of each concept.\nIn addition, we will work in the R programming language throughout the course, but no prior programming experience is required. We will spend the first three weeks going through exercises to get up to speed in R.\nStudents are encouraged to complete this self assessment prior to registering for the course to self-assess familiarity with these concepts."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Selection\nI want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible - you‚Äôll hopefully want to show off your final project in a portfolio or during job interviews. Accordingly, you get to choose the topic for your project, but it must meet certain guidelines.\nProjects must be selected during the first two weeks of class. Projects much be an emerging technology, product, or policy with a clearly identified market that has not yet been introduced into the mass market, such as a new invention from a research laboratory at GWU or a new product being explored by a firm. Students have the option to choose a sponsored project or propose their own project if it is approved by the instructor and meets the following criteria:\n\nInnovative / Emerging: The proposed project involves a new product or technology with attributes (e.g.¬†price, efficiency, reliability, size, performance, color, etc.) that may be competitive in the marketplace but for which actual market adoption is still uncertain.\nWell-Defined: This course focuses on mathematical modeling to support design decision-making. There is not sufficient time in the course for conceptual design of a new product.\nIdentified Target Market: A target market has been identified for this new product or technology. Competing products in that market are known, and the attributes on which new market entrants compete can be identified. Representative potential customers can be identified for survey solicitation. If the new product or technology is a component of a larger product sold to a consumer market, students may assess the market implications for the final consumer product.\nPrior to Mass Commercialization: The new product or technology has only recently or has not yet been introduced to the mass market.\nModerate Scope and Complexity: The product or technology should involve moderate complexity. For example, a non-differentiated commodity, such as sugar, is too simple, and a complex product involving many components and manufacturing operations, such as a vehicle, is too complex.\nExpertise: If the product involves a new technology that requires specialized knowledge about its attributes, the team should have reliable access to experts who can supply the requisite knowledge.\nDecision Variables: The product should have several non-trivial design decisions. For example, choosing between two materials or topologies, setting dimensions of a component, or selecting among a set of alternative component configurations are suitable design decisions. The models developed in the project will be used to support decision-making along such dimensions.\n\n\n\nTeamwork\nThe experience of working in teams on this project will serve as preparation for teamwork throughout your careers. Some teams may experience an imbalance in team member contributions, effort, or reliability. The instructor is available to provide advice and interact in resolving team inequity and conflict; however, students should view this as a learning experience. Such situations regularly occur in any career, and learning how to handle them is a valuable skill. If you experience challenges within your team, it is a good opportunity to develop strategies and figure out how you will address such challenges in the future. One common job interview question is, ‚ÄúDescribe a time when you experienced difficulties working in a team or experienced a team failure. What did you do about it?‚Äù This is a good chance to build a strong answer to this question."

Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate design insights. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a presentation of their findings. This course has a ‚Äúflipped‚Äù classroom structure. Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class, students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice questions."

You will not be told in advance when there is a quiz, and make up quizzes will not be available if you miss it (except for excused absences). Please show up on time to class each week to ensure that you do not miss a quiz.\nQuizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz. Quizzes are short (5-10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It‚Äôs a phenomenon known as the ‚Äúretrieval effect‚Äù - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won‚Äôt remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book ‚ÄúMake It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,‚Äù by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."
