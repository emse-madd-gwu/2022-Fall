    "text": "Installing packages from Github: the BRRR library\nThe vast majority of the time, you will install external packages using the install.packages() function. This installs packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), where most packages are published. But you can also install packages that are under development or haven‚Äôt been published to CRAN yet. Most of the time, these packages are hosted on GitHub - an online platform for sharing code (it‚Äôs also where all of the files that make up this website are stored).\nTo install a package from GitHub, you first need to install the remotes library. Then you can use the remotes::install_github()` function to install packages directly from GitHub. To try this out, install the remotes library, then trying installing the BRRR package:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"brooke-watson/BRRR\")\n\n\nNote: Packges on GitHub are in development and often require other packges to work. So if you get an installation error about some other package dependency, try restarting your R session and try again.\n\nNot sure what this package does? Well, one of the other nice things about packages listed on GitHub is the authors tend to write detailed descriptions - check out the GitHub page for the BRRR package. Then try using the BRRR::skrrrahh() function with different number arguments (turn your volume up). In the #welcome channel on slack, post your favorite argument to skrrrahh() (mine is 24)."

Notice that this week‚Äôs template is a .Rmd file.\n\n\n2. Readings\nNext week we will start getting into designing conjoint surveys for our projects. We will implement them using formr.org, which is an R-based platform for designing surveys. The platform allows you to use R or markdown code (just like you would in a .Rmd file) to define everything you see in an online survey. All survey elements are defined using Google Sheets.\nTo get familiar with the platform, go to this post on my website and watch the ~45 min video on the page. It is a recording of me introducing formr.org at a GW Coders community meet up back in 2021. The first 5 minutes is a high level introduction, and the rest of the video goes into a detailed demo of the platform.\nTake notes as you watch the video.\nAt the bottom of the page in the section titled ‚ÄúSurveys with {formr}‚Äù, you can see links to the actual surveys I used in the video.\n\n\n3. Make a practice survey\nNormally I would have each team create their own account on formr.org, but at the moment the site is undergoing several upgrades and they have temporarily suspended new accounts. So, the work around for this semester will be for every team to use the same account. I will post the log in information on the class Slack in the #projects channel.\nFor practice, try replicating the random images survey I demonstrated in the video. Follow these steps:\n\nMake a copy of the survey Google Sheet in GW Google Drive account. Make sure you turn the share settings on so that anyone can view it (if you don‚Äôt, formr won‚Äôt be able to read it in).\nLog in to formr.org and create a new survey using that Google Sheet. Name your survey practice_netID, replacing netID with your netID (e.g.¬†practice_jph).\nOnce you have your survey uploaded, you can make it live by creating a ‚ÄúRun‚Äù. Create a new run, and give it the same name as your survey name. Add your survey to the run by clicking on the  icon, then add a stopping point by clicking the  icon.\nThe link to the survey will be https://your_run_name.formr.org. You can control whether your survey is ‚Äúlive‚Äù or not by modifying the ‚Äúvolume‚Äù icons. I recommend setting it to the  icon, which means people who have the link can access the survey.\nTry it out! See if the survey works as expected. You can also click through a few times and then see the response data by going to your survey (not the run) in the formr.org admin page.\n\n\n\n4. Reflect & Knit\nReflect on what you‚Äôve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? After reflecting, do the following:\n\nWrite at least a paragraph in your Rmd file.\nClick the ‚Äúknit‚Äù button to compile your .Rmd file into a html web page.\nOpen up the resulting reflection.html file in your web browser and see how it looks!\n\n\n\n5. Submit\nTo submit this assignment, create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment. Name the zip file hw3-netID.zip, replacing netID with your netID (e.g., hw3-jph.zip). Then copy that zip file into the ‚Äúsubmissions‚Äù folder in your Box folder created for this class (the Box folder is named your GW netID)."

    "text": "Department: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with data analysis techniques to inform design decisions in an uncertain, competitive market; topics include consumer choice modeling, programming in the R programming language, survey design, conjoint analysis, optimization, market simulation, and professional communication skills. Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate design insights. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a presentation of their findings. This course has a ‚Äúflipped‚Äù classroom structure. Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class, students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice questions.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nImport, wrangle, visualize, and export data in R.\nDesign surveys to obtain informative data about consumer preferences for product features.\nBuild and estimate discrete choice models.\nAnalyze consumer choice data to estimate consumer preferences for product features.\nDesign and create effective charts and presentations.\nCommunicate results in terms of design insights.\n\nPrerequisites:\nThis course requires prior exposure to:\n\nProbability theory\nMultivariable calculus\nLinear algebra\nRegression\n\nEach of these concepts will be applied throughout the course, and no time will be spent reviewing the foundational elements of each concept.\nIn addition, we will work in the R programming language throughout the course, but no prior programming experience is required. We will spend the first three weeks going through exercises to get up to speed in R.\nStudents are encouraged to complete this self assessment prior to registering for the course to self-assess familiarity with these concepts."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Selection\nI want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible - you‚Äôll hopefully want to show off your final project in a portfolio or during job interviews. Accordingly, you get to choose the topic for your project, but it must meet certain guidelines.\nProjects must be selected during the first two weeks of class. Projects much be an emerging technology, product, or policy with a clearly identified market that has not yet been introduced into the mass market, such as a new invention from a research laboratory at GWU or a new product being explored by a firm. Students have the option to choose a sponsored project or propose their own project if it is approved by the instructor and meets the following criteria:\n\nInnovative / Emerging: The proposed project involves a new product or technology with attributes (e.g.¬†price, efficiency, reliability, size, performance, color, etc.) that may be competitive in the marketplace but for which actual market adoption is still uncertain.\nWell-Defined: This course focuses on mathematical modeling to support design decision-making. There is not sufficient time in the course for conceptual design of a new product.\nIdentified Target Market: A target market has been identified for this new product or technology. Competing products in that market are known, and the attributes on which new market entrants compete can be identified. Representative potential customers can be identified for survey solicitation. If the new product or technology is a component of a larger product sold to a consumer market, students may assess the market implications for the final consumer product.\nPrior to Mass Commercialization: The new product or technology has only recently or has not yet been introduced to the mass market.\nModerate Scope and Complexity: The product or technology should involve moderate complexity. For example, a non-differentiated commodity, such as sugar, is too simple, and a complex product involving many components and manufacturing operations, such as a vehicle, is too complex.\nExpertise: If the product involves a new technology that requires specialized knowledge about its attributes, the team should have reliable access to experts who can supply the requisite knowledge.\nDecision Variables: The product should have several non-trivial design decisions. For example, choosing between two materials or topologies, setting dimensions of a component, or selecting among a set of alternative component configurations are suitable design decisions. The models developed in the project will be used to support decision-making along such dimensions.\n\n\n\nTeamwork\nThe experience of working in teams on this project will serve as preparation for teamwork throughout your careers. Some teams may experience an imbalance in team member contributions, effort, or reliability. The instructor is available to provide advice and interact in resolving team inequity and conflict; however, students should view this as a learning experience. Such situations regularly occur in any career, and learning how to handle them is a valuable skill. If you experience challenges within your team, it is a good opportunity to develop strategies and figure out how you will address such challenges in the future. One common job interview question is, ‚ÄúDescribe a time when you experienced difficulties working in a team or experienced a team failure. What did you do about it?‚Äù This is a good chance to build a strong answer to this question."

Proposal Contents\nYour proposal should contain the following items listed as separate sections.\n\nNOTE: If your team is working on a policy project rather than a product, see the Policy Proposal Contents section below.\n\n\nAbstract\nA few sentences summarizing the overall proposal and convincing the reader why it is important. Specifically, tell the reader:\n\nWhat is the product you are studying?\nWhat key product attributes make it different than its competitors?\nWhat major design decision variables will you focus on for your analysis?\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nProvide a brief description and background of the product or technology. Include a picture or diagram of the product.\n\n\nMarket Opportunity\n\nIdentify Your Customer\nIf there are multiple potential markets, choose one to focus on for your analysis. Describe who you plan on taking your survey and how you intend to gain access to that population. You may survey customers of a ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù product, if appropriate (e.g.¬†survey electric vehicle buyers to learn about preferences for electric vehicle battery attributes).\n\n\nIdentify Competitors\nWhich other products will compete with yours? Benchmark how competitors compare on your product‚Äôs attributes.\n\n\nIdentify Market Size\nEstimate the size of the annual market (expected sales in units per year) for this product and its competitors. Specify if your estimated annual market size is regional, national, or global, and provide references.\n\n\n\nProduct Attributes & Decision Variables\nA key component of your proposal is to identify the relationships between your product attributes and decision variables.\n\nProduct Attributes\nThese are the product features that consumers observe and care about. For example, price is almost always an important product attribute that influences consumer choices. You should list and describe the major product attributes you will include in your analysis. Where possible, label the product attributes on the diagram of your design. Where possible, quantify the metrics for each attribute (e.g.¬†if one of your attributes is weight, the metric could be ‚Äúkilograms‚Äù). Also list the set or range of possible levels you plan to explore for each attribute (e.g.¬†for color you may choose the set {red, green, blue}, or for price you may choose the range $1 - $10).\n\n\nDecision Variables\nThese are key elements of the product / technology that the designers focused on in designing the product. For example, engineers might be trying to choose the best thickness for a solar cell, which affects multiple product attributes, including weight (thicker cells are heavier), price (thicker cells use more material), lifetime (cell thickness may affect how quickly a cell degrades), etc. You should discuss ~2-3 key decision variables that are related to your product‚Äôs design that you propose to consider. Discuss why you chose these variables, and label them on your diagram of the product design. For each variable, specify units and the range of potential values under consideration.\n\n\nModel Relationships Table\nInclude a clearly legible image of your model relationships table identifying relationships between your product attributes and decision variables. For now, these relationships can simply be directional (e.g.¬†cell thickness is positively related to cell weight). Use this example as a template.\n\n\n\nQuestions\nList major outstanding questions (e.g.¬†about the product / technology performance metrics, market opportunities, etc.) that you will need to know to conduct your analysis and how you propose to find answers. The purpose of this section is to identify high-priority items that you will need to know early on in your project."

Who are you planning on getting to take your survey, and how you intend to gain access to that population? Include an estimate of the size of the total target population.\n\n\nPolicy Options\n\nIdentify Policy Options\nWhich policies are you considering, and what are some of the potential pros and cons of them? Are some easier / more feasible to implement or enforce than others? Are some more costly to implement than others? Include a summary table comparing some basic features of each policy, e.g.\n\n\n\nPolicy\nDescription\nPro\nCon\n\n\n\n\nPolicy 1\nBrief description\nEasily implemented\nExpensive\n\n\nPolicy 2\nBrief description\nHard to enforce\nCheap\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Policy Attributes\nFor each policy, identify the key attributes that your target population will observe.

For each attribute, specify the range of possible levels you plan to explore (e.g.¬†for amount you may choose the range $1 - $10). You should choose levels that reflect the range of existing policies or potential policies.

Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention.

As a parent of young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise that leave parents with few other options.\nIn cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child‚Äôs needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.\nAll students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to class.\n\nI understand that sleep deprivation and exhaustion are among the most difficult aspects of parenting young children. The struggle of balancing school, work, childcare, and graduate school is tiring, and I will do my best to accommodate any such issues while maintaining the same high expectations for all students enrolled in the class.
